###Liteprint

Extension set for a quick & semiautomatic data pool for transform objects.

Just put '.lit' after any transform to access his powers.

- .litCreate( prepares a pool for the current transform (optional).
- .litSpawn( just like Instantiate but using a clone from the pool.
- .litRecycle(), use it on any spawned transform object to put it back in the
  pool again.
